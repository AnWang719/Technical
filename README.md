1.This project was built using React framework. All the relevant data is stored in JSON file and fetched from there into the application, which will be a matter of updating the file with more datasets in the later stage when an admin portal is developed.(some minor alterations might be needed in order to adapt accordingly).

2.A navheader is included into this assignnment for easy viewing of the two interactivies. but I assume they will be displayed seperatly hence the requirement they'll be displayed in different angle, so the code might need to be altered at later stage.

3.As for most touch screen computer nowdays comes with the ability of using mouse as well, so both mouse and touch events has been implemented in order to detect user activities.

4.The landing page image was set to fit the size of 27inch FHD (as stated) with fixed coords, therefore this assignment is idealy to be assessed on the right size. The hotspot images are responsive to different viewports.
